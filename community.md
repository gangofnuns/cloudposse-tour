How to connect with the broader SweetOps community. 

There's a great Slack Channel, with lots of SweetOps enthusiasts willing to connect. 

There's a great office hours session every week, which is frequently recorded and blogged, so you can catch up on previous discussions.  Also available on YouTube.
