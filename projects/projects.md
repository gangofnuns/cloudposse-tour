# Hands-on projects

Cloudposse has created three excellent tutorials for learning. 
#### 1.) [The Geodesic DevOps container.](https://github.com/cloudposse/tutorials)
#### 2.) [The Atmos scriptable wrapper](https://github.com/cloudposse/tutorials) (for automating terraform workflows). 
#### 3.) [Building a multi-account environment.]https://github.com/cloudposse/tutorials) 

These are essentially recipes for building various stacks or other reference infrastructures for the purpose of better understanding the tools and techniques at play. 

* Caveat:  None of these projects is considered fully formed at this point. These are all works in progress with no guarantees.

## Projects

### Full multi-account reference architecture.  
Includes a number of best-practices. Also strives to incorporate the most recent information about new tools available. 

### tfstate-backend
Instructions for building a stable and well-formed statate-backend component. 

### remote state 
A project specifically showcasing how to build a reusable remote state pattern, suitable for handling remote state requests from other components in a multi-account, multi-stack infrstructure. 

### SSO with AWS IAM integration
An quick reference implementation showing how to get an SSO infrastructure up and running quickly with Okta SSO (but easily relatable to any other Identity Provider.)

### Full multi-account infrastucture
